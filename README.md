# PART1：Orthogonal Annotation (Orthogonal_Annotation)

The orthogonal annotation tool is developed using MATLAB-GUI. If you have MATLAB installed on your computer, you can right-click on "orthogonal_annotation_tool.m" and select "Run."

If MATLAB is not installed on your computer, we also provide an executable (exe) version for Windows users. However, you will need to install the MATLAB Runtime environment first.

It should be noted that this tool is designed for orthogonal annotation of three-dimensional binary (.bin) seismic data. If you need to read data in other formats, you can modify lines 122 to 134 in "orthogonal_annotation_tool.m" to suit your specific requirements.
